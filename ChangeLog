2007-06-06  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Verify that the $logtime_pat variable is working in --reprocess
	  mode, and output a warning if it is not.
	- Don't short-circuit the starting_up code when using --reprocess.
	- Output a message at the end of the log when using --reprocess.

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Made the Cyrus pattern only match a successful login line.
	- Made the Courier-POP3 pattern match a TIMEOUT line in the $out_pat.

2006-10-10  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- The "Match Many Patterns" section now properly interprets
	  the [LOGTIME] string in the patterns it is given.

2006-03-24  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Added a couple debug log messages to the sync_sendmail()
	  function in the Sendmail SMTP section.

2006-03-17  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Added a new sample section that shows how to configure
	  pop-before-smtp to read its log data on stdin.  Also show
	  how to make syslog run the script and pipe it data.

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Include the version number in the starting-up log message.

2006-03-01  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp, pop-before-smtp.spec:
	- Upped the version to 1.41.

	* pop-before-smtp, pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Fixed a problem with the new $logtime_pat not handling a
	  space-padded day of the month.

2006-02-20  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp, pop-before-smtp.spec:

	- Added a patch for the 1.0 release of popa3d.

	* pop-before-smtp, pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Added a new configure variable: $logtime_pat.  This variable
	  lets the user change the default regex that is used to find
	  the time for each line of a logfile, something that the code
	  in pop-before-smtp was doing several places using hard-wired
	  regex values.  Also, the code now supports log-lines where
	  the time value is not at the start of the line.

2006-02-17  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:

	  $pat regex.
	- Improved the qpopper regex.

2005-10-08  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp:

	  queue.
	- When $out_pat is in use, we need to take extra care to avoid
	  adding a duplicate expiration event for an IP.

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Improved the $out_pat for UW POP/IMAP.

2005-08-10  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

2005-07-23  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* contrib/pat-tester:
	- Added a simple debug program that makes it easy to test a
	  $pat (and optionally an $out_pat) value against one or more
	  log files.

2005-07-22  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Don't allow an $out_pat match to insert an IP that wasn't
	  already inserted by a $pat match.

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Handle latest Courier POP/IMAP non-SSL log lines.

2005-07-13  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Detaint IP values that come from the DB at startup.

	* ip-blocking-conf.pl:
	- A new, alternate config file that finds attacking IPs in a
	  log file and blocks the IPs using iptables (or ipchains).
	  (Based on an implementation by Anton V. Popivnenko.)

2005-07-08  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Added method functions for the adding/deleting of items
	  to/from the DB.
	- Make sure that the startup-scan can't leave the DB locked.
	- Make sure that we don't call the the flock function more than
	  once in a row with the same "1" (or "0") parameter (which was
	  unlikely, but is now impossible).
	- Moved some function-pointer-init code so that the code that
	  implements the --list option can depend on its effects.
	- If --nowrite is specified, override the user's add_/del_func
	  pointers with no-op functions.
	- Release the flock in the --list code prior to starting the
	  output.

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Added $add_func and $del_func to the used variables list.
	- Some minor improvements to the locking functions.
	- Tweaked a couple comments.

2005-05-13  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	  and improved it to accept any IPv6 prefix on the IP.

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Optimized the startup log-scan when an $out_pat regex is
	  defined.

2005-01-06  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp, pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Added support for a new logout/disconnect pattern that
	  lets the user define an optional $out_pat variable, at
	  which point the program will keep track of concurrent
	  connections from each IP address and only expire the IP
	  when the last connection is closed.  This makes us work
	  better with connection-caching email clients, such as
	  Thunderbird's IMAP mode.

2005-01-05  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Turn on "use strict".
	- A few minor changes to make all the config sections work
	  with "use strict".

	* contrib/popa3d/popa3d-0.6.4.patch:
	- Updated a syslog define's name (SYSLOG_PRI_ERROR).

2004-11-13  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Added a Qpopper pattern that works when Qpopper is doing its
	  own logging (i.e. without syslog).
	- Added support for an $FAIL_pat that works when $PID_pat,
	  $IP_pat, and $OK_pat are defined (but is optional).  This
	  lets a user match a more verbose sequence of log lines where
	  the OK_pat line is not the first PID-matching message after
	  the IP_pat line (see the config file for more details).

2004-11-08  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- If $flock is not set, make sure that the --list option
	  doesn't try to flock the database.

2004-10-03  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp, pop-before-smtp.spec:

	  your site hasn't become an open relay.
	- Improved the start section.

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Improved the perldoc manpage.

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Made it a little more obvious that the $pat2 value would need
	  to be created with a "my" (due to the "use strict" setting).

	* contrib/README.QUICKSTART:
	- Improved the sendmail config details.

	* contrib/popauth.m4:
	- New file that has M4 macros for sendmail.  This was modified
	  by Alain Knaff from the official sendmail version to add in
	  some extra SPF support.

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Added a multi-line match rule for solidpop3d.

	- Import more Fcntl symbols, including the SEEK_* symbols
	  (which we now use) and the F_* symbols (which some optional
	  code in the config file needs).

2004-04-05  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Updated the pattern support for vm-pop3d.

2004-01-22  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- We now let the user configure how logfile-reading should be
	  done, with the new default being to use some simpler logfile-
	  reading functions that we provide. The user can override this
	  by setting $tail_init_func and $tail_getline_func.  This fixes
	  some out-of-control CPU use that some users experience using
	  File::Tail.

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Added a File::Tail config section that can be used to restore
	  the use of File::Tail for logfile reading.

2004-01-06  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Neatened up, consolidated, and enhanced the Qpopper patterns.  Also
	  eliminated the various "from" comments near each pattern (since they
	  were unfair in their incompleteness and also potentially distracting
	  to newbies).

2003-09-13  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Log the @mynets array if --debug was specified.
	- Check each item in @mynets and log an error for any that
	  don't parse.

2003-02-12  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Make sure that we don't push two items onto the queue that have an
	  identical expire time (they would cause a warning during
	  expiration).

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Added an optional call to setlogsock() in the syslog code for folks
	  that don't get any syslog output to uncomment.

2003-02-01  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Tweaked the Courier POP/IMAP pattern so that it will match a modern
	  log entry.

	  file.

	- Mention how to "emerge" the required modules on a Gentoo Linux
	  system.

2003-01-06  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Changed a few $pat values to omit the end-of-line match if we've
	  matched enough to already be confident that this is a success line.
	  This makes us a little more flexible when handling future log-line
	  changes.
	- Improved the Nick Bauer qpopper match line.

2002-07-15  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

2002-05-25  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Added the --dumpconfig option to show some basic config information.

	- Improved the slow-system expire check so that the last person
	  doesn't consistently get 2*$grace seconds of authorization.

	* contrib/README.QUICKSTART:
	- Fixed a couple spelling errors and the numbering of the steps.

	* pop-before-smtp.spec:
	- Use -q with %setup.
	- Weeded out a few things from the %doc dir.

	* contrib/getfromcpan:
	- Commented-out the code that deletes the RPMs.
	- Mentioned our changes and updated the version to 1.2.

	* contrib/README.QUICKSTART:

2002-04-17  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Added a couple comments.

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Change some comments to (hopefully) make things easier to wade
	  through.

2002-04-16  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Updated the Courier POP/IMAP pattern.
	- Added backslashes to several $pat vars in front of the IP-dot chars.
	- Added an example custom_match() subroutine that efficiently matches
	  multiple regular expressions.

	* README, contrib/README.QUICKSTART:
	- A few more improvments for the new version.

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Fixed the IP address in the expiration-event log message.
	- Mentioned that we depend on Date::Format now (which is a part of
	  the TimeDate module that is already a dependency).

2002-04-15  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Updated the pod doc to have all the latest options, to list what
	  all the options do, to order the info a little better, and to not
	  make it sound like Postfix is the only SMTP software we work with.
	- Fixed the usage message, and tweaked the Getopt config a bit.

2002-04-14  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Fixed --nodebug (my changes had made it work the same as --debug).
	- Added $logto variable to make overriding our output-log easier.
	  E.g. the previous config might have called set_output_log(),
	  which could fail (if we're not root) and trying to override it
	  with --logto on the command-line wouldn't do so soon enough to
	  avoid this.

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Changed the code that used set_output_log() and \&log_to_stdout to
	  set the new $logto var.

	* pop-before-smtp:

	- Added an introductory comment.

	* contrib/README.QUICKSTART:
	- Updated to handle the new config file and improve a few things.

	* contrib/getfromcpan:
	- Read the %_topdir out of the .rpmmacros file (if it exists).
	- Put all the module versions numbers in variables at the top of the
	  file and updated them to their most-current values.
	- Fixed all the echoes with unbalanced double-quotes.
	- Fixed a couple of the sanity checks.
	- Fixed the pre-installation cleanup to cleanup the SOURCES dir.
	- Allow the script to be run as non-root to just build the RPMs (it
	  skips installing the RPMs, and also does not remove them).

	* contrib/perlmod2rpm:
	- Updated to look in ~/.rpmmacros for the %_topdir definition and use
	  that in place of /usr/src/redhat if found.

	* pop-before-smtp.spec:
	- Added potential support for installing a custom config file.
	- Put the unchanged config file into the doc dir.
	- Tweaked the %post and %preun sections to not re-run on update.

2002-04-13  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	- Allow the finding of the mynetwork value to be configured.
	- Use time2str() for our stdout-log timestamp.

	  tcprules, and Courier SMTP.
	- Added $dbvalue section.
	- Added /var/log/mail.log to the list of known watch-log values.

	- Updated the info related to syslog setup.
	- Changed the notes concerning Courier SMTP and qmail.

	* TODO:
	- Removed several finished items, added something new.

	* COPYING:
	- Tweaked the Copyright.

2002-04-13  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Removed the dashes from the current (pre-release) version number.

	* pop-before-smtp.spec:
	- Updated the Version/Source/Packager/URL.
	- Since we're installing the docs as a separate man page, strip the
	  pod doc out of the installed script.
	- Install the config file in /etc.
	- Added %clean.
	- Fixed the man-page reference in the %files section to work even if
	  the file gets compressed.
	- Put the ChangeLog in the doc dir.

	* pop-before-smtp.init, contrib/init-redhat-{alex,bet}:
	- Tweaked a few things to increase the similarity between the
	  various init scripts while still preserving the significant
	  differences.

	* contrib/README.QUICKSTART:
	- Tell people to send fixes to the mailing list.
	- Fixed the line-wrapping glitches.

2002-04-12  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

2002-04-11  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Added the --logto=FILE option.
	- Removed the day-of-the-week from the stdout timestamp.
	- Don't force the extra expiration check quite so often.

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Mention the new set_output_log() function, and put the syslog()
	  setup next to it.
	- Added Courier-POP3 to the Courier-IMAP pattern.
	- If the default watch-log path doesn't exist, try to figure out one
	  that does.

	* pop-before-smtp.init:
	- Only intuit command-line options if there is no config file present.
	- Added code for Mandrake's /var/log/mail/info log file.
	- Got rid of hard-coded /usr/bin path to ps (ps is in /bin on many
	  systems).

2002-04-10  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Moved the config items into a config file and added the
	  --config=FILE option to override its default location.
	- Enabled only one $pat variable by default (UW).
	- Added the ability to use a custom_match() function to enable more
	  complex watch-log matching.
	- Changed the name of the --logfile option to --watchlog (though we
	  still accept --logfile for backward compatibility).
	- Added the --reprocess option (for debug processing of old log data).
	- Changed the optional output-log messages to have a timestamp, be a
	  little more concise, and support being easily overridden.  This
	  makes it trivial to support syslog() output.
	- Log what signal killed us (if logging).
	- Write the "die" message to the output log (if logging).

	* TODO:
	- Mention a couple items that I'd like to do.
	- Got rid of the separate-config discussion (which is now done).

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Moved the various user-selectable $pat values here.
	- Added pattern for Perdition.
	- Include the various overridable parameters that a user might want to
	  tweak.
	- Added an example custom_match() function for vm-pop3d support (since
	  it requires parsing 2 lines to determine success).
	- Added the necessary setup for using syslog() (commented out).

2002-04-10  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Improved cleanup_nets() to weed-out comments from included files,
	  de-taint the mynetworks include-file data, and to make the code a
	  little simpler.
	- Changed the expiration code to better ensure that expired IPs don't
	  hang around overly long.
	- Updated the URL to the mailing list and the project's home page.
	- Moved the change-log data into this ChangeLog file.
